--------------------------
cividev
--------------------------
Issue one command to create a Virtual Machine that comes pre-configured with all the tools you'll need for CiviCRM development. Upon the first VM startup, installs a Drupal 7 site with CiviCRM, and civicrm-buildkit (see above) so you can easily create any number of sites with CiviCRM on any supported CMS. Shout-out to @cividesk for contributing this awesome tool!
